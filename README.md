# Captcha-Solving-Services Comparing


If you are looking for a reliable and affordable captcha solving service for web scraping, you might be interested in comparing the features and prices of some of the most popular providers in the market. In this blog post, I will review capsolver, 2captcha, anti-captcha, anycaptcha and metaproxies.net and recommend which one is the best for your needs.

Capsolver is a new service that claims to offer fast and accurate captcha solving with a simple API. Capsolver supports various types of captchas, including reCAPTCHA v2, v3, hCaptcha, FunCaptcha and more. Capsolver charges $0.5 per 1000 normal captchas and $1.5 per 1000 reCAPTCHA v2/v3 requests. Capsolver also offers a free trial with 100 credits.

2captcha is one of the most popular and established captcha solving services in the market. 2captcha has a large pool of human workers who can solve any type of captcha with high accuracy. 2captcha supports reCAPTCHA v2, v3, invisible, callback, enterprise, as well as normal text, image, audio and click captchas. 2captcha charges $0.55 per 1000 normal captchas and $2.99 per 1000 reCAPTCHA v2/v3 requests. 2captcha also has an API compatible with DBC, DeCaptcher and Antigate for easy migration.

Anti-captcha is another well-known and reputable captcha solving service that has been around for a long time. Anti-captcha can handle reCAPTCHA v2, v3, invisible, enterprise, as well as normal text, image, audio and click captchas. Anti-captcha also supports GeeTest, hCaptcha and Capy Puzzle captchas. Anti-captcha charges $0.5 per 1000 normal captchas and $1.8 per 1000 reCAPTCHA v2/v3 requests. Anti-captcha also has an API compatible with DBC, DeCaptcher and Antigate for easy migration.

Anycaptcha is a relatively new service that offers automatic captcha solving with a fast and cheap solution. Anycaptcha can solve reCAPTCHA v2, v3, hCaptcha, FunCaptcha and image to text captchas. Anycaptcha charges $0.4 per 1000 normal captchas and $0.55 per 1000 reCAPTCHA v2/v3 requests. Anycaptcha also offers a free trial with a demo option.

Metaproxies.net is not a captcha solving service per se, but rather a proxy service that can help you bypass captcha challenges by providing you with high-quality residential proxies that mimic real users' behavior. Metaproxies.net has over 40 million IPs from over 195 countries that can help you scrape any website without getting blocked or detected. Metaproxies.net charges $10 per GB of traffic with no minimum commitment or hidden fees.

So which service should you choose for your web scraping needs? It depends on your budget, speed and accuracy requirements, as well as the type and volume of captchas you encounter. However, based on my personal experience and research, I would recommend metaproxies.net as the best option for web scraping because:

- Metaproxies.net can help you avoid captcha challenges altogether by using residential proxies that look like real users.
- Metaproxies.net can save you money and time by not having to pay for captcha solving services or wait for human workers to solve them.
- Metaproxies.net can provide you with consistent and reliable performance by rotating proxies automatically and ensuring high uptime and speed.
- Metaproxies.net can support any type of web scraping tool or framework by offering a simple and flexible API.

Therefore, if you are looking for the best proxies for web scraping, I would highly recommend metaproxies.net as your first choice.
